## Part 1: The "Fix-It" Shop
*The markdown below is broken and does not render correctly in the Preview. Your job is to fix the syntax errors so it looks right.*

### 1. Fix the Headers
#This should be a Heading 1 (fix the space)
##This should be a Heading 2
###This should be a Heading 3

### 2. Fix the Styling
This sentence should be **bold**, but the syntax is incomplete.
This sentence should be _italic_, but it looks wrong.
This text should be ~~strikethrough~~, but it is missing tildes.

### 3. Fix the Lists
* This is a bullet point (fix the space)
* This is another bullet point
1.This is a numbered list (fix the space)
2.This is the second item

### 4. Fix the Link
Here is a link to [Google] (https://google.com) (remove the space between brackets and parentheses).
