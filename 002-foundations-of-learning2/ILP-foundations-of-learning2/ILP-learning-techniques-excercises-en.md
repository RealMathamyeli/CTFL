# **🚀 Your Individual Learning Afternoon: From Knowledge to Skills**

Hello! These 2.5 hours are all yours. The goal is not just to understand the powerful learning techniques and strategies we discussed, but to make them your own. You will analyze, experiment, and develop your own personalized learning system.

Take your time with each block. It's not about speed, but about the depth of insight.

**Total Duration:** approx. 2.5 hours
**You'll need:** A notebook (digital or physical), internet access, and the willingness to try new approaches.

## **Block 1: The Power of Structuring (approx. 60 minutes)**

_(Focus: Mind mapping & Chunking)_

<br>

### **🎯 Task 1: The Master Mind Map (45 min.)**

**Goal:** You create a comprehensive mind map on a topic of your choice and internalize the principles of visual structuring.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Choose your topic:** Pick a topic that really interests you, but about which you don't know everything yet. It should be complex enough to divide it well.
    - _Ideas:_ "The History of the Internet", "How Does an Electric Motor Work?", "The Main Characters and Storylines of My Favorite Series", "Basic Principles of Healthy Nutrition".
2.  **Research & Chunking:** Research your topic online for about 15-20 minutes. **Your goal is not to know everything!** Your goal is to identify the **rough main areas (chunks)**. Find 4-6 logical main chapters for your topic.
3.  **Create the Mind Map:**
    - Take a large sheet of paper or a digital mind mapping tool (e.g., [Coggle](https://coggle.it/), [MindMaster](https://www.mindmeister.com/), [XMind](https://xmind.com/)).
    - Write your main topic in the center.
    - Draw a thick main branch for each of your "chunks".
    - Now add the most important keywords and details as smaller branches to each main branch.
    - **Use colors and small symbols!** Give each main branch its own color and draw at least 5 small pictures that replace or complement keywords.

**Reflection (at the end of the block):** Briefly note what this method has brought you. Was it easy to find the structure? Did the visual work help you?

<br>

### **🧩 Task 2: Chunking in Everyday Life (15 min.)**

**Goal:** You train your brain to actively break down large amounts of information.

**Instructions:**
Find three examples from your everyday life or work where you unconsciously or consciously apply or could apply "chunking". Write them down.

- _Example 1 (Password):_ "I remember my long password `Summer24!Sun&Beach` as three chunks: `Summer24!` - `Sun` - `&Beach`."
- _Example 2 (Daily Plan):_ "I don't plan my day as one long to-do list, but in blocks: 'Morning Chunk' (emails, meeting preparation), 'Midday Chunk' (project work), 'Afternoon Chunk' (calls, wrap-up)."
- _Example 3 (Learning):_ "..." (Find your own third example!)

## **Block 2: Active Processing & Sustainable Storage (approx. 75 minutes)**

_(Focus: SQ3R & Spaced Repetition)_

<br>

### **📖 Task 3: The Text Detective with SQ3R (45 min.)**

**Goal:** You apply the SQ3R method to a challenging text and experience the difference between passive and active reading.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Find your text:** Look for an interesting but also somewhat challenging online article (about 2-4 pages long).
    - _Ideas:_ A news background report (e.g., from TIME, The Atlantic), a technical article about your hobby, a blog post about a new technology.
2.  **Apply SQ3R step by step:** Take your notebook and document the process.
    - **(S) Survey (5 min.):** Skim only headings, images, and the first/last paragraph. Note: "The topic seems to be... The main sections are..."
    - **(Q) Question (5 min.):** Formulate 3-4 central questions to the text that you want answered. Turn the subheadings into questions.
    - **(R) Read (15 min.):** Now read the text actively with the goal of answering your questions. Mark the answers in the text or take notes.
    - **(R) Recite (10 min.):** Cover the text. Formulate the answers to your questions **in your own words**. Write them down. Be honest: If you can't explain it, you haven't understood it yet.
    - **(R) Review (10 min.):** At the end, look only at your questions and your self-formulated answers. Summarize the key message of the entire text in a single sentence.

<br>
<br>

### **🗓️ Task 4: Your Personal Spaced Repetition System (30 min.)**

**Goal:** You prepare a system to secure important knowledge from your everyday life or work in the long term.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Choose your tool:** Decide on a system.
    - _Digital (recommended):_ Download the free app **Anki** (Ankiweb.net for desktop, AnkiDroid for Android, AnkiMobile for iOS/paid) and install it. Watch a 5-minute tutorial on YouTube to understand the basics.
    - _Analog:_ Take 10-15 blank index cards and label 3 envelopes or boxes with "Daily", "Weekly", and "Monthly".
2.  **Collect your knowledge:** Think about the last few weeks. What information, facts, names, technical terms, or concepts did you want to remember but forgot again?
3.  **Create your first 5 flashcards:** Formulate 5 cards according to the principle "question on the front, answer on the back".
    - **Good cards are specific and atomic (only one piece of information per card)!**
    - _Bad:_ "Explain Spaced Repetition."
    - _Good:_ "Which learning method combats the 'forgetting curve' through repetition at increasing intervals?" -> "Spaced Repetition"
4.  **Start the process:** Enter the cards into your system (in Anki: into your first "deck"; analog: into the "Daily" box) and do your first learning session.

## **Final Reflection (approx. 15 minutes)**

Finally, take a moment and answer these questions for yourself in your notebook:

1.  Which of the four techniques felt most natural to me and why?
2.  Where do I see the greatest potential to concretely integrate one of these methods into my everyday life (work, studies, hobbies) starting tomorrow?
3.  What was my most important insight about my own learning behavior during these 2.5 hours?
