## 💻 Coding Exercises

Now it's time to practice! Try solving these exercises on your own to reinforce what you've learned today in Pyhon introduction.

## NOTE:

- For each exercise, create a new Python file using the exercise title as the filename (e.g., `exercise1_hello_you.py`).
- Write your code in the file and run it using your terminal, for example:

```bash
python exercise1_hello_you.py
```

- Feel free to experiment and modify the code to see how it works!
- You may need to research some methods or functions online — that's a normal part of programming!
- push your completed exercises as usual with `git add .`, `git commit -m "completed exercises"`, and `git push`.

### Exercise 1: Hello, You!

Write a program that:

- Asks for the user's name using `input()`
- Prints a personalized greeting using `print()`

**Example output:**

```
What is your name? Sarah
Hello, Sarah! Welcome to Python programming!
```

### Exercise 2: Simple Calculator

Create a program that:

- Asks the user for two numbers
- Prints the sum of those two numbers

**Hint:** Remember that `input()` returns a string, so you'll need to convert it to a number using `int()` or `float()`.

**Example output:**

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 25
The sum is: 35
```

### Exercise 3: About Me

Write a program that asks the user several questions and then displays all the information together:

- Name
- Age
- Favorite color
- Hometown

**Example output:**

```
What is your name? Alex
How old are you? 23
What is your favorite color? Blue
Where are you from? Berlin

--- Your Profile ---
Name: Alex
Age: 23
Favorite Color: Blue
Hometown: Berlin
```

---

### Exercise 4: Year Calculator

Create a program that:

- Asks for the user's birth year
- Calculates and prints how old they are (or will be) in 2026

**Example output:**

```
What year were you born? 2000
In 2026, you will be 26 years old!
```

### Exercise 5: Story Builder

Write a program that asks the user for different words and then creates a short story using them:

- An animal
- A color
- A place
- An action (verb)

Then print a sentence using all these words.

**Example output:**

```
Enter an animal: cat
Enter a color: purple
Enter a place: library
Enter an action: dancing

Once upon a time, a purple cat was dancing in the library!
```
