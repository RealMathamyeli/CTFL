## **Block 1: Your Workspace Audit & Makeover (approx. 60 minutes)**

_(Focus: optimizing the workspace & minimizing distractions)_

### **🎯 Task 1: The 360° Workspace Check (30 min.)**

**Goal:** Identify all distractions and optimization opportunities at your physical and digital workspace.

**Instructions:**

1. **Analog workspace (15 min):**

   - Sit down at your typical study spot (desk, kitchen table, etc.).
   - **Inventory:** What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What distracts you before you even start?
   - **Make a list:** Write down at least 5 concrete things that bother or distract you in your physical workspace (e.g., clutter, poor lighting, too cold/hot, loud noises outside, uncomfortable chair).
   - **Quick fixes:** Choose the 2 easiest points from your list and implement them **immediately** (e.g., “Tidy up desk,” “Open window,” “Adjust lamp position”).

2. **Digital workspace (15 min):**

   - Open your laptop/PC.
   - **Inventory:** Look at your desktop. How many browser tabs are open? Which apps are running that you don’t need? What do you see on your smartphone home screen?
   - **Make a list:** Write down at least 5 concrete digital distractions (e.g., too many desktop icons, social media/email notifications, entertainment tabs, phone within reach).
   - **Quick fixes:** Choose the 2 easiest points from your list and implement them **immediately** (e.g., “Close unnecessary browser tabs,” “Disable phone notifications for 30 minutes”).

**Reflection (right after):** Did you already feel more focused after implementing your quick fixes? What was the biggest change?

### **🚫 Task 2: Your Distraction Shield Plan (30 min.)**

**Goal:** Develop a personalized plan to actively minimize external and internal distractions.

**Instructions:**

1. **External distractions (15 min):**

   - Think about your top external distractions (people, noises, sudden events).
   - **Develop 3 concrete rules or strategies:** What can you actively do to reduce them?

     - _Example 1 (Roommates):_ “I hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on my door when I study.”
     - _Example 2 (Noise):_ “I use my headphones with white noise when it gets too loud.”
     - _Example 3 (Phone):_ “During study time, my phone always goes in another room or a drawer.”

2. **Internal distractions & focus boosters (15 min):**

   - Think about your top internal distractions (wandering thoughts, overthinking, tiredness).
   - **Develop 2 concrete strategies:** What will you do to regain focus?

     - _Example 1 (Thought parking lot):_ “I keep a notepad for ‘later thoughts’ so I can write them down and forget them until later.”
     - _Example 2 (Ritual):_ “Before I start, I drink a glass of water and take 3 deep breaths to get into study mode.”
     - _Example 3 (Breaks):_ “I use fixed 5-minute breaks to move a little.”

## **Block 2: Your Personal Time Management System (approx. 90 minutes)**

_(Focus: study plan & prioritization)_

### **🗓️ Task 3: Drafting a 7-Day Study Plan (45 min.)**

**Goal:** Create a realistic and flexible study plan for the coming week.

**Instructions:**

1. **Big picture (10 min):**

   - What are your **study goals** for the coming week? (e.g., “Understand Biology chapters 1–3,” “Prepare presentation X,” “Learn vocabulary”). Write down all tasks and topics.
   - What **fixed commitments** (work, university, sports, social events) do you have that can’t be moved? Put them in your calendar.

2. **Study blocks & buffers (20 min):**

   - Identify the **gaps** in your calendar where you can study.
   - Realistically plan 3–5 **fixed study blocks** for the week (e.g., “Monday, 5:00–6:30 PM: Biology”). Remember: 90 minutes of focused study is often more effective than 3 hours of distracted study.
   - Very important: Add at least 1–2 **buffer times** (30–60 minutes each) to rescue you if something takes longer or something unexpected happens.

3. **Assign tasks (15 min):**

   - Now distribute your study tasks across the planned blocks. Mix heavy and light tasks.
   - Plan a 5–10-minute **break** for each block!

**Reflection (right after):** How does it feel to have a plan in front of you? Do you feel more relaxed now that you have structure?

### **🚦 Task 4: Setting Priorities with the Eisenhower Matrix (45 min.)**

**Goal:** Learn how to evaluate tasks by importance and urgency and set the right priorities.

**Instructions:**

1. **Brainstorm all tasks (15 min):**

   - Write down EVERYTHING that comes to mind for the next week – not just study tasks, but also personal errands, work tasks, things on your mind (e.g., “Do laundry,” “Answer emails,” “Call friend,” “Update resume,” “Finish presentation”). The goal is a long list.

2. **Classify into the Eisenhower Matrix (15 min):**

   - Create the four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix (Important/Urgent, Important/Not Urgent, Not Important/Urgent, Not Important/Not Urgent).
   - Go through your list point by point and assign each task to a quadrant. Be brutally honest with yourself.

3. **Your weekly focus (15 min):**

   - Review the quadrants:

     - **Quadrant A (Important & Urgent):** What are the absolute top priorities you must tackle immediately?
     - **Quadrant B (Important & Not Urgent):** This is the key quadrant! Which 2–3 tasks here will move you forward most in the long run? How can you add them to your study plan before they become urgent?
     - **Quadrant C (Not Important & Urgent):** Which tasks can you eliminate, delegate, or quickly check off to get rid of them?
     - **Quadrant D (Not Important & Not Urgent):** Which tasks will you completely cut because they’re pure time-wasters?

   - Write one sentence that summarizes your **study focus for the upcoming week**, based on your prioritization.

## **Final Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)**

At the end, take a moment to answer these questions in your notebook:

1. Which insight from “time management” and “learning environment” was most valuable for me today?
2. What is the ONE thing I will firmly integrate into my daily routine starting tomorrow to study more efficiently?
3. How has my perspective on my tasks and my study space changed through these exercises?
