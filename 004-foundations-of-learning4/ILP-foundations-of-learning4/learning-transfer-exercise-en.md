# **🚀 Your Individual Learning Afternoon: From Knowledge to Action – and Getting Better!**

Hello! These 2.5 hours are your chance to consolidate what you’ve learned by applying it and putting your personal learning strategies to the test. You’ll become the “Chief Learning Officer” of your own learning: you’ll plan, execute, analyze, and optimize.

Take your time with each block. The goal is to gain deep insights and define concrete steps for your future learning journey.

**Total duration:** approx. 2.5 hours
**You need:** A notebook (digital or physical), a pen, internet access (if you choose a project that requires research).

## **Block 1: Start Your Individual Learning Project (approx. 75 minutes)**

_(Focus: Formulating learning goals & applying knowledge)_

### **🎯 Task 1: Define My SMART Learning Goal (20 min)**

**Goal:** You formulate a concrete and motivating learning goal for the near future that truly helps you move forward.

**Instructions:**

1. **Brainstorming (5 min):**

   - What is a topic, skill, or problem area you really want to actively improve or learn in the next 2–4 weeks? (It could be work-related, personal, or for further education.)
   - Write down 2–3 ideas.

2. **Make it SMART (15 min):**

   - Choose the most attractive idea.
   - Turn it into a clear learning goal using the **SMART formula**:

     - **Specific:** What exactly?
     - **Measurable:** How will I recognize success?
     - **Achievable:** Is it realistic within the time?
     - **Relevant:** Why is it important to me?
     - **Time-bound:** By when exactly do I want to achieve it?

   - _Example: “By [date in 3 weeks], I can apply the 10 most important Excel functions (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, conditional formatting) using sample data to create a monthly report in 30 minutes.”_

### **🏗️ Task 2: Design Your Learning Transfer Project (55 min)**

**Goal:** You plan a concrete project or real task to directly apply the knowledge from your SMART goal.

**Instructions:**

1. **Develop a project idea (15 min):**

   - Based on your SMART goal from Task 1: What is a concrete project or real task where you _must_ apply your new knowledge or skill?
   - _Example (Excel goal):_ “My project is to create a fictional monthly report with sales and customer data in Excel, deliberately using pivot tables and VLOOKUP.”
   - _Example (language goal):_ “My project is to write an email to an English-speaking customer and correctly use 5 new business vocabulary words.”

2. **Project planning with chunking (20 min):**

   - Break your project into 3–5 small, logical, and manageable steps (chunks).
   - Give each step a short title.
   - _Example (Excel project):_ “1. Import raw data into Excel. 2. Create a pivot table for sales analysis. 3. Use VLOOKUP for customer segmentation. 4. Prepare a visually appealing report.”

3. **Time scheduling (20 min):**

   - Take your calendar for the next 2–3 weeks.
   - Schedule a specific **study/implementation block** for each project step. Be realistic with timing.
   - Add **buffer times** and **breaks**.
   - _(Goal: After this task, you’ll have a real roadmap of when you’ll do what to achieve your learning goal through a project.)_

## **Block 2: Reflection on Your Learning Journey & Strategy Optimization (approx. 75 minutes)**

_(Focus: Analyzing experiences & adjusting strategies)_

### **🔬 Task 3: Your Learning Methods Checklist (30 min)**

**Goal:** You systematically analyze which of the methods you’ve learned have worked best for you so far and why.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a methods list (5 min):**

   - Write the following methods on a sheet:

     - Mind mapping
     - SQ3R method
     - Spaced repetition / flashcards
     - Chunking
     - Time management (study plan / prioritization)
     - Workspace optimization
     - Focus strategies (thought parking lot, distraction minimization)

2. **Experience check (25 min):**

   - Go through each method and briefly (in bullet points) answer:

     - **Have I actively tried this method?** (Yes/No)
     - **What went well when I used it?** (1–2 positives)
     - **What were the biggest difficulties/challenges?** (1–2 negatives)
     - **Which learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) did this method appeal to most for me?**
     - **How could I improve or use this method differently?** (future idea)

### **🔧 Task 4: Your Personal Optimization Plan (45 min)**

**Goal:** You create a concrete plan to improve your learning strategies based on your reflections.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prioritize potential improvements (10 min):**

   - Look at your answers from Task 3. Which 2–3 methods have the greatest potential for improvement, or where did you face the biggest challenges you want to tackle?
   - Choose the **two most important** methods you want to optimize.

2. **The 3-step optimization plan (25 min):**

   - For each of the two methods, develop a concrete optimization plan:

     - **Method 1 (e.g., SQ3R):**

       - **My problem/challenge:** (e.g., “In the ‘Recite’ step, I don’t really say the content out loud, only in my head.”)
       - **My adjustment/strategy change:** (e.g., “From now on, I’ll place a stuffed animal in front of me and explain the content out loud to it to force myself to speak.”)
       - **My success check:** (e.g., “After the next 3 texts, I’ll check if I really spoke out loud.”)

     - **Method 2 (e.g., workspace optimization):**

       - **My problem/challenge:** (e.g., “My desktop is still cluttered and distracting.”)
       - **My adjustment/strategy change:** (e.g., “I’ll spend 5 minutes tidying up my desktop before finishing each day and move all unnecessary files into an ‘Archive’ folder.”)
       - **My success check:** (e.g., “Every morning I’ll check if the desktop is clean and start with 0–1 open tabs.”)

3. **Your “exchange topic” (10 min):**

   - Consider: Which topic or challenge from your reflection would you like to discuss with a colleague, friend, or mentor? Write this down as a short note so you’re ready to bring it up next time.
   - _Example: “How do you actually manage to keep your phone away while studying? I keep failing at this.”_

## **Final Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)**

At the end, take a moment to answer these questions in your notebook:

1. What was my most important insight about myself and my learning during these 2.5 hours?
2. How does it feel to have such a concrete plan for a learning project and strategy optimization?
3. What “next small step” will I take immediately after this session to continue my learning journey?
