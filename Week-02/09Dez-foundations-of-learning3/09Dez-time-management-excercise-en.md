## **Your Guide: Step by Step to Optimized Learning**

Take the suggested amount of time for each step. Be honest and practical in your reflections.

### **Part 1: Your Study Profile Today (approx. 5 minutes)**

1. **Analyze your desk:** Look around you, or check your digital desktop. What distracts you? What could be improved? Write down 2–3 concrete things that bother you (e.g., “Too many sticky notes,” “Clutter on the desktop,” “Phone always within reach”).
2. **My biggest distractions:** What are the typical things that break your flow while studying? (e.g., “Checking messages,” “Noise from outside,” “Feeling hungry”). Note 2–3 of them.
3. **My biggest study challenge:** What is currently your most urgent study task or biggest learning problem you need to find time for? Write down this one challenge.

### **Part 2: Your Master Plan for Tomorrow (approx. 15–20 minutes)**

Now create a concrete mini-plan for one study day (tomorrow or any upcoming day), applying all the strategies you’ve learned.

1. **📝 The 1-Day Study Plan (5–7 min):**

   - Choose a specific day (e.g., “Tomorrow, Wednesday”).
   - Write down 2–3 study tasks you want to complete on that day (refer to the learning challenge from Part 1).
   - Schedule **fixed study blocks** in your calendar (with start and end times). Don’t forget to include **fixed breaks** (e.g., “10:00–11:30: Study Block A, 11:30–11:45: Break”).

2. **🚦 Prioritizing Tasks (3–5 min):**

   - Take your 2–3 study tasks for tomorrow.
   - Place each task in the **Eisenhower Matrix**:

     - Is it **Important & Urgent**? (DO IMMEDIATELY!)
     - Is it **Important & Not Urgent**? (SCHEDULE & PLAN!)
     - Is it **Not Important & Urgent**? (DELEGATE OR MINIMIZE!)
     - Is it **Not Important & Not Urgent**? (ELIMINATE!)

   - Write down the quadrant for each task and your chosen approach.

3. **🧘 Your Optimized Study Start (5–8 min):**

   - **My workspace is ready:** Which 2–3 measures from Part 1 (analog & digital) will you implement _right before_ your first study block tomorrow to optimize your environment? (e.g., “Clean up desktop,” “Close unnecessary tabs,” “Put phone in the drawer”).
   - **Distraction shield:** Which 1–2 focus strategies (e.g., “Use thought parking lot,” “Put on headphones,” “Close the door”) will you actively apply to minimize disturbances and stay focused?

---

**The Goal:** You’ll have created a clear, realistic, and personalized plan for an effective study day. You know what you want to study, when you will do it, and how you will prepare your environment—and yourself—for success.
