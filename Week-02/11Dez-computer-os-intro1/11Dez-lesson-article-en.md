# 🖥️ Computer Hardware

Computer hardware is all the parts of your computer you can physically touch. Everything that is _physical_. From the screen down to the smallest wire on the motherboard. Without hardware, a computer is just a pile of ideas; the hardware makes it come alive.

<br><br><br>

## 🧩 Components of a Computer

Think of a computer like a band. Each member has a special role, but only together do they play the hit. Or like a brain with its helpers. Here are the main players:

<br><br><br>

### 🧠 The Processor (CPU – Central Processing Unit)

- **The brain:** The processor is the absolute centerpiece and brain of your computer. It’s a tiny chip that can perform billions of calculations per second.
- **The thinker & calculator:** It takes instructions (e.g., “Open Word,” “Calculate 2+2,” “Display this picture”), processes them, and sends commands to other components. Everything your computer does somehow runs through the processor.
- **Speed:** Processor performance is often measured in gigahertz (GHz). The higher the number, the faster it can process instructions. Modern processors often have multiple “cores” (Intel Core i3, i5, i7, i9; AMD Ryzen 3, 5, 7, 9), which act like several small brains working in parallel.
- **Where it sits:** The processor sits on the **motherboard**, the main circuit board of your computer that connects all components together.

<br><br><br>

### 🏃 Memory (RAM – Random Access Memory)

- **The short-term memory:** Think of RAM as an extremely fast notepad. When you open a program or edit a file, the processor loads the necessary information there.
- **Temporary data:** This is where all the data the processor _actively_ needs or is working on is stored. It can access and modify it very quickly.
- **Volatile:** The key difference from drives: RAM is “volatile.” That means once you shut down the computer or close the program, the data in RAM is gone. To keep something, it must be saved to a drive.
- **More = better:** More RAM means your computer can have more programs open simultaneously or work with larger files without slowing down. If you don’t have enough, the computer constantly has to swap data between RAM and the hard drive, which makes it very slow.

<br><br><br>

### 💾 Drives (Data Storage)

Drives are your computer’s long-term memory. This is where all your programs, documents, photos, videos—basically everything—is permanently stored, even when the computer is turned off.

1. **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):**

   - **The classic type:** These are magnetic disks that spin very fast. A read/write head hovers over them to access data.
   - **Advantages:** Cheap and lots of storage (often terabytes).
   - **Disadvantages:** Mechanical parts make them slower than SSDs and more prone to damage from shocks.

2. **Solid State Drives (SSDs):**

   - **The modern type:** SSDs have no moving parts. They store data on flash memory chips (similar to USB sticks, but much faster).
   - **Advantages:** Extremely fast (computers boot in seconds, programs open instantly), robust (no moving parts), silent.
   - **Disadvantages:** More expensive per gigabyte than HDDs, though prices are steadily dropping.
   - **Standard today:** Ideally, every computer should have an SSD for the operating system and main programs.

<br><br><br>

### 🔌 Peripherals (Input and Output Devices)

These are all the devices connected to your computer that enable communication between you and the machine.

1. **Input devices:** Used to send commands or information into the computer.

   - **Keyboard:** For text and commands.
   - **Mouse:** For navigating on the screen.
   - **Microphone:** For voice input.
   - **Webcam:** For pictures and video.
   - **Scanner:** For digitizing physical documents.

2. **Output devices:** Used to display or output information from the computer.

   - **Monitor/screen:** Shows visual information.
   - **Printer:** Produces paper copies.
   - **Speakers/headphones:** For audio output.
   - **Projector:** Projects the screen image onto a large surface.

| Device     | Type   | Function               |
| :--------- | :----- | :--------------------- |
| Keyboard   | Input  | Text entry, commands   |
| Mouse      | Input  | Navigation, clicking   |
| Microphone | Input  | Voice input, recording |
| Monitor    | Output | Screen display         |
| Printer    | Output | Prints onto paper      |
| Speakers   | Output | Audio playback         |
| Webcam     | Input  | Video capture          |
| Scanner    | Input  | Document digitization  |

## ⚙️ Overview of How a Computer Works

How do all these components work together? Imagine it as a dance where everyone knows their role. (EVA principle – Input, Processing, Output)

1. **You enter a command (Input):** You click with the **mouse** on a program icon or type text with the **keyboard**.
2. **The command is processed (Processor & RAM):**

   - The command goes to the **processor (CPU)**.
   - The processor asks: “Do I have everything I need in **RAM**?”
   - If yes, it’s very fast. If not, the processor fetches the necessary program parts or data from the **hard drive (storage)** into RAM, which takes longer.
   - The processor executes the calculations, processes your input, or opens the program.

3. **The result is output (Output):**

   - The processor sends the results to the **output devices**.
   - You see the program on the **monitor**.
   - Your typed text appears on the screen.
   - Music plays through the **speakers**.

4. **Saving data permanently (Drive):**

   - When you save your work (e.g., a Word document), the processor moves the data from fast but volatile RAM to permanent storage on the **drive (SSD/HDD)**.

**The key point:** All this happens in fractions of a second. The faster your components (especially CPU, RAM, SSD), the smoother and quicker everything runs. Your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) acts as the conductor, coordinating all components and processes.

<br><br><br>

# 🖥️ Operating System Interface

The operating system interface, often called the Graphical User Interface (GUI), is what you see when your computer boots up. It’s the bridge between you and the complex technology behind the scenes. Instead of typing complicated commands, you click on icons, windows, and menus. That’s what makes computers usable for all of us!

<br><br><br>

## 🧭 Recognizing and Using Basic Elements

No matter if you use Windows, macOS, or Linux, most interfaces share similar elements that help you control the computer. Think of them as the furniture in your digital living room.

<br><br><br>

### 🏡 The Desktop: Your Digital Desk

The desktop is what you see when your computer starts up and no programs are open.

- **The name says it all:** It’s like your real desk, where you place your most important tools and documents for quick access.
- **Icons:** Small images that represent programs (e.g., the browser), files (e.g., a Word document), or folders (e.g., “My Pictures”). A double-click opens them.
- **Background image:** The picture that decorates your desktop. You can change it to whatever you like.
- **Purpose:** The desktop is your starting point for many actions and offers quick access to frequently used items.

<br><br><br>

### 🚀 The Taskbar (Windows) / The Dock (macOS): Your Command Center

The taskbar (bottom in Windows) or the dock (bottom/side in macOS) is your constant companion and central hub.

| Element                  | Windows (Taskbar)                                                                       | macOS (Dock)                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start Menu/Launchpad** | Bottom left, the Windows logo. Opens the main menu with programs and settings.          | The rocket symbol (Launchpad) in the dock. Shows all installed apps.         |
| **Pinned Programs**      | Icons of programs you often use and have pinned for quick access.                       | Icons of programs you often use and have pinned.                             |
| **Active Programs**      | Icons of currently open programs (often marked with a line or shadow).                  | Icons of currently open programs (often marked with a small dot underneath). |
| **Search Function**      | A search field or magnifying glass. Quickly finds programs, files, or even web content. | Magnifying glass at top right (Spotlight) or in the dock.                    |
| **Notification Area**    | Bottom right (time, date, Wi-Fi, volume, etc.).                                         | Top right (date, time, Wi-Fi, battery, etc.).                                |

**Purpose:** The taskbar/dock lets you quickly launch programs, switch between open apps, and keep key system info in view.

<br><br><br>

### 📜 The Start Menu (Windows) / The Launchpad (macOS): Your Program Catalog

The start menu (Windows) or Launchpad (macOS) is your gateway to all installed programs and key system settings.

- **In Windows:** Click the Windows logo bottom left. It opens a menu with program lists, quick access to documents, settings, and the power button.
- **In macOS:** Click the rocket symbol in the dock. It shows all apps across multiple screens, like on a smartphone.
- **Purpose:** It’s the central place to find and launch programs, even if they’re not pinned to the desktop or dock. You can also shut down or restart here.

<br><br><br>

## 🖼️ Window Management and Basic Navigation

Most of your work on a computer happens in “windows.” A window is the area on your screen where a program (e.g., your browser, Word, a game) runs or a file is displayed.

<br><br><br>

### 🪟 Managing Windows: The Frame of Your Work

Each window has typical control elements always in the same place:

- **Title bar:** Top of the window. Shows the program or file name. You can grab and drag it to move the window.
- **Buttons top right (Windows):**

  - **Minimize:** A line (–). Hides the window from the desktop but keeps it running (visible on the taskbar).
  - **Maximize/Restore:** A square. Maximizes to full screen or restores to original size.
  - **Close:** An X. Closes the program or file.

- **Buttons top left (macOS):**

  - **Close (Red):** Closes the window.
  - **Minimize (Yellow):** Minimizes it into the dock.
  - **Maximize (Green):** Maximizes to full screen or optimal size.

- **Resize:** Drag the edges or corners to adjust the window size.

<br><br><br>

### 📁 Navigating the OS: Finding Files and Folders

Your computer stores all files in a folder structure, like a huge digital filing cabinet.

1. **File manager (Explorer in Windows / Finder in macOS):**

   - The key program to manage your files. Usually in the taskbar/dock (Windows: folder icon; macOS: blue smiley icon).
   - Shows your drives, folders, and files.

2. **Folder structure:**

   - You have main folders (e.g., “Documents,” “Pictures,” “Downloads”).
   - Inside these, you can create subfolders to stay organized (e.g., “Documents → Work → Project X”).
   - Clicking a folder opens it and shows its contents.

3. **Path:**

   - At the top, you often see the “path” (e.g., “This PC > Documents > Work > Project X”). This shows exactly where you are.

4. **Search:**

   - The file manager almost always has a search field (often top right). Enter a file name to quickly find it.

**Goal of navigation:** Know how to access files, create folders to stay organized, and quickly find what you need. A tidy folder structure saves endless time and nerves!

<br><br><br>

# ⚙️ Basic Settings

The basic settings are your personal control center. Here, you define how your computer looks, feels, and responds to you. Knowing where to find these makes your digital workspace comfortable and efficient.

<br><br><br>

## 🎨 Adjusting Time, Language, and Display Options

These are essential to ensure your computer functions correctly and feels right for you.

<br><br><br>

### ⏰ Setting Date and Time

Why is this important? Correct time is crucial for many computer functions, such as file timestamps, program operation, or secure online connections.

1. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Right-click the clock in the taskbar (bottom right) and select “Adjust date/time,” or go to “Settings” → “Time & language.”
   - **macOS:** Click the time at the top right → “Open Date & Time Preferences,” or go to “System Preferences” → “Date & Time.”

2. **What you can set:**

   - **Automatic sync:** Usually best left on. The computer syncs with an internet time server to stay accurate.
   - **Time zone:** Check that the correct time zone is set (e.g., Berlin for Central European Time).
   - **Manual setting:** Only use if automatic setting fails.

<br><br><br>

### 🗣️ Changing Language Settings

The language of your OS and keyboard is crucial for operation.

1. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Start menu → “Settings” → “Time & language” → “Language.”
   - **macOS:** “System Preferences” → “Language & Region.”

2. **What you can set:**

   - **Display language:** Defines the language menus and texts are shown in (e.g., German, English).
   - **Preferred languages:** Add multiple languages, e.g., for websites or apps.
   - **Keyboard layout:** Very important! For instance, if you select an English keyboard, Y and Z are swapped and special characters are in different places.

<br><br><br>

### 🖼️ Adjusting Display Options

So you can see everything clearly and adapt the screen to your needs.

1. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Right-click on the desktop → “Display settings,” or Start menu → “Settings” → “System” → “Display.”
   - **macOS:** “System Preferences” → “Displays.”

2. **What you can set:**

   - **Background image:** Change the desktop wallpaper.
   - **Screen resolution:** The sharpness of the image. The highest/recommended resolution is usually best. Lowering resolution makes things larger but less sharp.
   - **Scaling (text, apps, other elements):** Increase size without changing resolution if text/icons look too small.
   - **Brightness:** Adjust to what feels comfortable for your eyes.

## 🚪 Logging In/Out, Restarting, and Shutting Down

These are the basic commands for starting, ending, or switching users. Like getting in and out of your “computer car” and turning the key.

<br><br><br>

### 🔑 Logging In

1. **When:** Each time you start your computer or wake it from sleep, you’re usually asked for your username and password.
2. **Why it matters:** This protects your personal data from unauthorized access. Each user has their own profile, settings, and files.
3. **What to do:** Enter your username (if not pre-selected) and password, then press Enter or click “Log in.”

<br><br><br>

### 🚪 Logging Out

1. **When to use:** If you share your computer and want to leave your workspace without shutting it down completely. The computer stays on, but your profile is closed.
2. **What happens:** All your programs close (or you’re asked to save), and you return to the login screen. Someone else can then log in.
3. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Start menu → Profile picture → “Log out.”
   - **macOS:** Apple menu (top left) → “Log Out [username].”

<br><br><br>

### 🔄 Restarting

1. **When to use:** If your computer is slow, a program has frozen, after updates, or when issues occur. Restarting often fixes small problems.
2. **What happens:** The computer fully shuts down and immediately powers back on. RAM is cleared, and processes start fresh.
3. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Start menu → Power button → “Restart.”
   - **macOS:** Apple menu (top left) → “Restart…”

<br><br><br>

### 🛑 Shutting Down

1. **When to use:** If you don’t need the computer for a while or want to move it.
2. **What happens:** The computer completely powers off. All programs close (save your work first!).
3. **Where to find it:**

   - **Windows:** Start menu → Power button → “Shut down.”
   - **macOS:** Apple menu (top left) → “Shut Down…”

**Important note:** Simply closing the laptop lid or briefly pressing the power button often puts the computer into **sleep mode** instead. This uses little power but keeps programs/data in RAM for quick resume. For a full “clean reset,” use Restart or Shut down.
