# Part 1: DOM & Selectors

**1. What is the DOM?**
What do the letters **DOM** stand for, and what kind of structure does it create in the browser's memory?

**2. Selecting by ID**
If an HTML element has a unique ID (e.g., `<h1 id="main-heading">`), which JavaScript method is the fastest and most direct way to select it?

**3. Selecting with CSS Syntax**
Which method allows you to select elements using standard CSS selectors (like `.classname`, `#id`, or `tagname`), and how many elements does it return?

**4. Changing Text Content**
What is the difference between using `.textContent` and `.innerHTML` when changing the content of an element? Which one is safer?

**5. Changing Attributes**
If you have an image element stored in a variable (e.g., `let myImage = ...`), how can you change its image source (`src`) using JavaScript?

# Part 2: Events & Interaction

**6. Adding an Event Listener**
What is the name of the method used to attach a function to an HTML element so it responds to interactions (like a mouse click)?

**7. Event Types**
In the code `button.addEventListener('click', showMessage)`, what does the string `'click'` represent?

**8. Removing Event Listeners**
Why is it necessary to use a **named function** (instead of an anonymous function) if you want to remove an event listener later using `removeEventListener`?

**9. The Event Object**
When an event occurs, the browser creates an **event object**. What does the property `event.target` tell you?

**10. Stopping Default Behavior**
If you want to stop a link from opening a URL or a form from submitting when clicked, which method on the event object should you call?
