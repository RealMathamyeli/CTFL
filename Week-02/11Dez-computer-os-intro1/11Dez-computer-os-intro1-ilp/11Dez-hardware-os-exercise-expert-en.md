# **🚀 Your Computer Deep-Dive & Optimization Lab (for Advanced Users)**

Hello! These 2.5 hours are your chance to take your already solid computer knowledge to the next level. The goal is not only to know the _what_ and the _how_, but also the _why_ and _what if_. You will act as a system architect and optimizer, precisely controlling your system’s performance and configuration.

Take your time with each block. It’s about diving deep and truly mastering your system.

**Total Duration:** approx. 2.5 hours
**You need:** Your computer (laptop/PC) with admin rights, a notebook (digital or physical) and a pen, and internet access for advanced research.

## **Block 1: Hardware Tuning & System Analysis (approx. 60 minutes)**

_(Focus: Deeper understanding of components & their interaction)_

### **🎯 Task 1: Detailed System Analysis & Bottleneck Identification (30 min)**

**Goal:** Identify potential hardware bottlenecks in your system and understand how each component impacts overall performance.

**Instructions:**

1. **Retrieve advanced system information (15 min):**

   - Use built-in system tools or third-party apps (e.g. CPU-Z, HWMonitor, Speccy – _short research and installation allowed_) to gather detailed specs:

     - **CPU:** Model, cores/threads, base clock, current load frequency (check with Task Manager/Activity Monitor under heavy load).
     - **RAM:** Total capacity, number of modules, frequency (MHz), timings (CL values).
     - **Drives:** Type (NVMe SSD, SATA SSD, HDD), exact model, remaining free space on your main drive.
     - **GPU:** Model, VRAM size.

   - Record all values in your notebook.

2. **Bottleneck analysis (15 min):**

   - Based on your data and main use case (e.g. gaming, video editing, office work):

     - **Identify the likely bottleneck.** Which component is the limiting factor? (e.g. too little/slow RAM, old HDD, weak CPU/GPU).
     - **Justify your conclusion** in detail.
     - **Suggest 1–2 hardware upgrades** that would provide the biggest performance boost for your case.

### **⚙️ Task 2: Monitoring & Resource Management (30 min)**

**Goal:** Learn to monitor resources in real time and understand how active processes impact your hardware.

**Instructions:**

1. **Performance monitoring (15 min):**

   - Open **Task Manager (Windows)** or **Activity Monitor (macOS)**.
   - Check the "Performance" tab (Windows) or "CPU", "Memory", "Disk" (macOS).
   - Observe usage of CPU, RAM, disk (and GPU if available) when:

     - a) Launching a demanding program (e.g. video editing, large game).
     - b) Opening many browser tabs.

   - Note which component spikes the most for each action.

2. **Process analysis & optimization (15 min):**

   - Open the "Processes" tab (Windows) or "CPU/Memory" (macOS).
   - **Identify:** Which 3 processes use the most CPU? Which 3 use the most RAM?
   - **Action:** Close one heavy process and observe changes.
   - **Reflection:** Which programs could you regularly close to free resources? How would that impact system stability and speed?

## **Block 2: Advanced UI & File Management (approx. 50 minutes)**

_(Focus: Workflow efficiency & enhanced navigation)_

### **🏡 Task 3: Desktop Personalization & Efficiency Tuning (25 min)**

**Goal:** Use advanced UI features to optimize workflow and speed up access.

**Instructions:**

1. **Virtual desktops/workspaces (15 min):**

   - **Action:** Create 2–3 new virtual desktops (Windows: Task View button; macOS: Mission Control).
   - **Arrange:** Assign programs to different desktops (e.g. "Work" on Desktop 1, "Research" on Desktop 2, "Communication" on Desktop 3).
   - **Reflection:** How could virtual desktops improve your multitasking?

2. **Power-user access (10 min):**

   - **Windows:** Open the "Power User Menu" (right-click Start button). Identify 3 entries useful for advanced users (e.g. Device Manager, Disk Management, Run).
   - **macOS:** Use Spotlight (Cmd+Space) to quickly launch system tools (e.g. Terminal, Activity Monitor, Disk Utility).

---

### **📁 Task 4: Advanced File Management & Automation (25 min)**

**Goal:** Master advanced file features and think about automation.

**Instructions:**

1. **Context menus & properties (15 min):**

   - Pick a file (e.g. an image or document).
   - **Right-click:** Explore available options (e.g. "Send to", "Open with", "Properties").
   - **Check properties:** Note details like size, creation date, type, path.
   - **Shortcuts/Aliases:** Create a shortcut (Windows) or alias (macOS) to a frequently used folder on your desktop.

2. **Automation (10 min):**

   - Research briefly: How can you automate tasks on your OS?

     - _Windows:_ "Task Scheduler", batch scripts.
     - _macOS:_ Automator, AppleScript.

   - **Plan an automation:** Sketch how you could move all files in "Downloads" older than 30 days into an "Archive" folder. (You don’t need to implement it, just describe the approach.)

## **Block 3: System Configuration & Safety (approx. 40 minutes)**

_(Focus: Deeper settings & troubleshooting)_

### **🎨 Task 5: Advanced System Settings (20 min)**

**Goal:** Explore and understand deeper configuration options.

**Instructions:**

1. **User accounts (10 min):**

   - Go to "User Accounts" (Windows) or "Users & Groups" (macOS).
   - What account types exist (Admin, Standard)?
   - What are the security implications? Why should you use Admin rights only when needed?

2. **Advanced display options (10 min):**

   - Go to display settings.
   - **Multi-monitor setup:** If possible, connect a second monitor (or simulate settings). How would you arrange screens (extend, duplicate)?
   - **Night mode/Night Shift:** Find and enable it. What benefits does it have for your eyes and sleep?

---

### **🛑 Task 6: Boot Options & Emergency Use (20 min)**

**Goal:** Understand boot options and system commands for troubleshooting.

**Instructions:**

1. **Startup options research (10 min):**

   - Find out how to enter "Safe Mode" (Windows) or "Safe Boot" (macOS).
   - **What is Safe Mode?** Note its use cases (e.g. troubleshooting drivers, software errors).
   - Find the key combo to access BIOS/UEFI (Windows) or Startup Manager (macOS) during boot.

2. **System commands explained (10 min):**

   - Compare: "Shutdown", "Restart", "Sleep", "Hibernate".
   - Research technical differences (power use, data in RAM vs. disk).
   - For each command, note one situation when you’d use it.

## **Final Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)**

Take a few minutes to answer these in your notebook:

1. Which hardware info or system setting you discovered today was new and useful for you as an advanced user?
2. Which optimization (hardware upgrade idea, software setting, workflow tweak) will you implement next?
3. How has your sense of “control” over your computer changed through these exercises?
