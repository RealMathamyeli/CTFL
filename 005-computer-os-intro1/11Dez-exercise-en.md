# **🚀 Your Computer Check-up: From the Inside Out**

### **Your Scenario**

Imagine you’re a freshly minted “computer specialist.” A friend asks you for help setting up and understanding their new computer. You know it’s important to be familiar with both the basic hardware and the operation of the operating system and its settings.

### **Your Mission & Goal**

Your mission is to create a **checklist for your friend** that explains the most important hardware components, helps them navigate the interface, and shows them how to adjust basic settings. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview in 20–25 minutes and practically document the most important steps.

### **Key Facts**

- **Duration:** 20–25 minutes
- **Tools:** Your own computer, a notebook (digital or physical), and a pen

## **Your Guide: Step by Step to a Computer Expert’s Checklist**

Take the suggested time for each step. Work directly on your computer to check the points.

### **Part 1: Understanding the Inside (approx. 7 minutes)**

1. **🧠 Hardware Profile (7 min):**

   - Create a short “hardware profile” for your friend’s (or your own) computer.
   - Write a **short, simple explanation** for the following components and why they matter:

     - **Processor (CPU):** (What’s its role? Hint: “The brain”)
     - **Memory (RAM):** (What’s its role? Hint: “Short-term memory”)
     - **Drive (SSD/HDD):** (What’s its role? Hint: “Long-term memory”)
     - **At least two peripherals:** (Choose two, e.g., keyboard and monitor. What’s their function?)

   - _The goal is to explain these components in a way your friend understands without being an expert._

### **Part 2: Navigation & First Steps (approx. 10 minutes)**

1. **🏡 Interface Orientation (5 min):**

   - Write down for your friend how they can recognize and use the following basic interface elements:

     - **Desktop:** (What is it used for? What’s typically there?)
     - **Taskbar/Dock:** (Where is it? Name 2–3 functions.)
     - **Start Menu/Launchpad:** (How do you open it? What’s it for?)

2. **🪟 Window & File Practice (5 min):**

   - **Window control:** Briefly describe how your friend can maximize, minimize, and close a window. Test these steps yourself on any open window (e.g., your browser).
   - **Find a file:** Describe how your friend can open the file manager (Explorer/Finder) and locate a sample file (e.g., “HolidayPhotos.jpg”) in a folder (e.g., “Pictures”).

### **Part 3: Basic Adjustments (approx. 5–8 minutes)**

1. **⚙️ Personalization Check (3–4 min):**

   - Write down where your friend can find and change the following settings:

     - **Date & Time:** (Brief description of the navigation path)
     - **Display Language:** (Brief description of the navigation path)
     - **Background Image:** (Brief description of the navigation path)

   - Walk through these steps on your own computer to find the paths. You don’t need to change anything, just locate them.

2. **🛑 System Control (2–4 min):**

   - Briefly explain to your friend the difference between **“Shut Down”** and **“Restart”** and when each is used.
   - Describe how to shut down and restart the computer in your operating system.

**The Goal:** You’ve created a clear, simple, and practical “Computer Starter Guide” that helps your friend (and yourself) understand and use the basic functions of a computer. You’ve put theory into practice by walking through and documenting the steps yourself.
