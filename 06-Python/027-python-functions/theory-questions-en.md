   - Name at least three advantages of organizing code into modules.

8. **How do you import and use a function from Python's standard library?**
   - Give an example using the `random` or `math` module.

9. **What is the difference between `import math` and `from math import sqrt`?**
   - Describe how you would call the square root function using each import method.

10. **Why is `from module import *` generally considered bad practice?**
    - What problems can this import method cause in your code?
