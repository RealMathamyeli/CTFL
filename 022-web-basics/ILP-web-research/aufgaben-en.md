### ## Part 1: Decoding the Web – The Theory

**🎯 Learning Goal:** You can explain how the Internet works using the client–server model and understand the crucial importance of HTTPS.

**Research Tasks (approx. 60 min)**

1. **The Client–Server Model:**

   * Research and explain in your own words the roles of **client** and **server** on the World Wide Web.
   * Create a simple sketch or text diagram that shows the flow of a request from your browser (client) to a web server and back.
2. **Transmission Paths:**

   * Describe what happens “in transit.” What roles do concepts like **IP address** and **DNS (Domain Name System)** play in this process?
3. **The Language of the Web: HTTP vs. HTTPS:**

   * Find out what the abbreviations **HTTP** and **HTTPS** stand for and what their basic purpose is.
   * Explain the key difference between the two, especially regarding **security and privacy**. Why is the “S” in HTTPS so essential today?

### ## Part 2: Laying the Foundation – Your First HTML File

**🎯 Learning Goal:** You can create a valid HTML5 boilerplate and understand the purpose of the `<head>` section and its most important elements.

**Practical Tasks (approx. 45 min)**

1. **Create the File:** On your computer, create a new folder for this project. Inside it, create a new, empty text file and name it `index.html`.
2. **Write the Boilerplate:**

   * Open `index.html` in your text editor.
   * Manually write the **minimal boilerplate of an HTML5 document**.
   * Make sure your boilerplate correctly nests `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
3. **Populate the `<head>`:**

   * Research and briefly explain the **main purpose** of the `<head>` element.
   * Add a `<title>` element to your `<head>` with the text “Meine erste Webseite” (“My First Website”). Open your `index.html` file in a web browser. Where do you see your title?
   * Research and add the **most important `<meta>` tag** that ensures correct display of umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and special characters.

### ## Part 3: The Shell – Structuring Content

**🎯 Learning Goal:** You can semantically structure and format text content using the most important HTML tags.

**Practical Tasks (approx. 45 min)**
Now add content to the `<body>` of your `index.html` file:

1. **Heading Hierarchy:**

   * Give your page a main heading (`<h1>`) titled “Willkommen auf meiner Seite” (“Welcome to my page”).
   * Create two subsections, each with an `<h2>` heading (e.g., “Über mich” / “About me” and “Meine Ziele” / “My goals”).
   * Under one of the `<h2>` headings, add another subdivision with an `<h3>`.
2. **Paragraphs and Emphasis:**

   * Under each heading, write at least one paragraph (`<p>`) with a few sentences of placeholder text.
   * Research the semantic (meaning-related) difference between the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags.
   * Apply `<strong>` to a word you want to mark as “particularly important,” and `<em>` to a word you want to “emphasize for meaning.”
3. **Structural Elements:**

   * Insert a **horizontal rule** (`<hr>`) between your two `<h2>` sections to signal a thematic break.
   * In one of your paragraphs, write a fictitious address. Use the `<br>` tag to place the street line and the city/postal code line directly underneath each other **without** starting a new paragraph.
4. **Final Check:** Save your `index.html` and reload it in the browser to admire your structured shell.

### ## Your Self-Reflection 💡

Excellent! Today you bridged the gap from the abstract concept of the Internet to your first structured HTML page. Take a moment to reflect:

* **The “Aha!” Moment:** What was the most surprising insight from researching how the Internet works?
* **Code Feel:** How did it feel to write the HTML boilerplate and tags yourself? Where were you uncertain?
* **Structure vs. Appearance:** Were you able to grasp the difference between a tag’s *meaning* (e.g., `<h1>`) and its *appearance* (e.g., “big and bold”)?
* **Next Step:** What frustrates you most about the look of your current page, and what would you like to learn next to change that?
