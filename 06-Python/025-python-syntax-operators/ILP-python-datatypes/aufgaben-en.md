✨ Welcome to your individualized learning phase!

This is your exclusive journey, specifically designed to deepen your understanding of the powerful world of Python. Consider this phase your personal laboratory, where you can experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them – completely without pressure, but with the goal of sustainably solidifying your knowledge. Immerse yourself in the logic of the code, feel the elegance of the syntax, and experience the satisfaction when your programs come to life. Use this time not only to solve tasks but also to sharpen your problem-solving skills and develop your intuition for good coding practices. Good luck and, most importantly: Have fun discovering!

## Task 1: The Dynamic Currency Converter with Added Value

### Description

You are to develop a Python program that not only converts an entered amount of money into a target currency but also shows you what this original amount would look like in a _third_ currency. This requires a good understanding of user input, mathematical operations, and careful handling of data types.

### Objective of the Task

Consolidation of handling `input()` and `print()`, declaration and assignment of `float` variables, and the application of mathematical operators in a practical application.

### Requirements

1.  **Starting Value:** Prompt the user to enter an amount in Euros (EUR). Store this value in a suitable `float` variable.
2.  **Exchange Rates:** Define two different exchange rates as `float` variables directly in your code:
    - A rate from EUR to US Dollar (USD), e.g., `1 EUR = 1.08 USD`.
    - A rate from EUR to Japanese Yen (JPY), e.g., `1 EUR = 165.25 JPY`.
3.  **USD Calculation:** Calculate how many USD the entered Euro amount corresponds to. Store the result in a new `float` variable.
4.  **JPY Calculation:** Calculate how many JPY the _original_ Euro amount (from step 1) corresponds to. Store this result also in a new `float` variable.
5.  **Output:** Display all results clearly and neatly formatted on the console. Show the original EUR amount, the converted USD amount, and the converted JPY amount.
6.  **Comments:** Add meaningful comments to your code explaining what individual sections do and why certain variables were named as they were. Pay attention to sensible indentation of your code.

- Example Output:

```
---Currency Conversion Results:
Original Amount in EUR: 100.00
Converted Amount in USD: 108.00
Converted Amount in JPY: 16525.00
```

### Estimated Time

~50 minutes

## Task 2: The Intelligent Profile Analysis Tool

### Description

Create an interactive program that collects various personal information from a user and generates a summary profile from it. This profile should not only display the directly entered data but also draw a simple conclusion based on the information.

### Objective of the Task

Deepening the handling of various data types (`str`, `int`, `bool`), more complex user inputs (`input()`), variable assignment, and structured console output with `print()`.

### Requirements

1.  **Data Collection:** Prompt the user consecutively to enter the following information:
    - `Name` (String)
    - `Age` (Integer)
    - `Hometown` (String)
    - `Profession` (String)
    - The question: "Are you interested in Python programming? (yes/no)" (Expect 'yes' or 'no' and convert the answer into a `Boolean` variable).
2.  **Variables:** Store each input in a suitably named variable with the correct data type.
3.  **Age Category:** Based on the entered `Age`, assign a category to the user. Store this category as a String in a new variable:
    - If the age is less than 25: "Young Enthusiast"
    - If the age is 25 or greater: "Experienced Professional"
4.  **Profile Output:** Create a comprehensive yet concise profile summary. This should contain all collected information as well as the derived age category and be attractively displayed on the console. Ensure that the output is easily readable and structured.
5.  **Comments:** Use comments to explain the declaration of variables and especially the logic for the age category.

- Example Output:

```
---User Profile Summary:
Name: Alice
Age: 30
Hometown: Berlin
Profession: Data Scientist
Interested in Python programming: True
Age Category: Experienced Professional
```

### Estimated Time

~50 minutes

## Task 3: The Geometry Comparison Challenge

### Description

Your task is to write a Python program that queries the dimensions of two different geometric shapes (a rectangle and a circle) and then calculates their area and circumference. Finally, the program should compare the areas of both shapes.

### Objective of the Task

Application of user input (`input()`), `float` data types for calculations, mathematical operators, and structured output for presenting complex results.

### Requirements

1.  **Rectangle Data:** Prompt the user to enter the `length` and `width` of a rectangle. Store these as `float` variables.
2.  **Rectangle Calculations:**
    - Calculate the `area` of the rectangle (`length * width`) and store it.
    - Calculate the `circumference` of the rectangle (`2 * (length + width)`) and store it.
3.  **Circle Data:** Prompt the user to enter the `radius` of a circle. Store this as a `float` variable.
4.  **Circle Calculations:**
    - Define Pi as a `float` variable (e.g., `3.14159`).
    - Calculate the `area` of the circle (`Pi * radius * radius`) and store it.
    - Calculate the `circumference` of the circle (`2 * Pi * radius`) and store it.
5.  **Result Output:** Display all calculated areas and circumferences clearly labeled on the console, separated for rectangle and circle.
6.  **Area Comparison:** Compare the calculated areas of the rectangle and the circle. Output a statement to the console indicating which shape has the larger area or if both areas are equal.
7.  **Comments:** Use comments to explain the formulas for area and circumference, as well as the comparison logic. Pay attention to clean code structure and indentation.

- Example Output:

```
---Rectangle Results:
Length: 5.0
Width: 3.0
Area: 15.0
Circumference: 16.0
---Circle Results:
Radius: 4.0
Area: 50.26544
Circumference: 25.13272
The rectangle has the larger area.
```

### Estimated Time

~50 minutes

### Self-Reflection

After completing all tasks, take a moment to reflect on your work:

1.  **Challenges:** Which of the tasks or concepts (e.g., data types, operators, indentation) challenged you the most? Why?
2.  **Approaches to Solutions:** Were there alternative ways to solve the tasks that came to mind during or after programming?
3.  **Code Quality:** Are you satisfied with the readability and structure of your code? Where do you see potential for improvement (e.g., in variable names, comments, indentation)?
4.  **Learnings:** What is the most important thing you have taken away from this individualized learning phase?
5.  **Next Steps:** Which topics or concepts would you like to explore or practice further next to expand your Python knowledge?

This reflection will help you consolidate your understanding and consciously shape your learning path.
